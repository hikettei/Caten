  (subtitle "Full Hackable Kernel Generator")
  (body "
The `caten/codegen` is a system designed to JIT-compile AASM Graphs into other languages, such as C or Metal, to achieve faster computation.

This package has the following two objectives:

1. **Device Independence**: It imposes no constraints on the execution device, allowing users to extend it with only 200â€“300 lines of code.

2. **Performance**: It ensures computations run fairly fast on each target device.

Caten's code generation is divided into two stages based on the intended purpose:

1. **caten/codegen** Generates unoptimized code (e.g., Scheduler, Lowerer, op fusion, etc.).

2. **caten/polyhedral** __(Optional)__ Performs advanced kernel loop transformations and optimizations on the scheduled code, such as Auto Scheduler.

This document focuses on the first stage, `caten/codegen`, and provides related information and some examples.")

  (subtitle "How to enable JIT")
  (body "
To enable JIT, you need to set the `JIT` contextvar before running the function `caten`. The following code snippet demonstrates how to enable JIT on repl:
```
;; Option1: Set globally
(setf (ctx:getenv :JIT) 1)
;; Option2: Set locally
(ctx:with-contextvar (:JIT 1)
  ;; ...
)
```
After setting the contextvar, you can run the function `caten` to JIT-compile the AASM Graphs, e.g.:
```
(caten (!rand `(3 3)))
```")
  (subtitle "How to debug JIT")
  (body "
You can set the `JIT_DEBUG` contextvar to debug the JIT compilation process. The debugging level ranges from 0 to 4, as shown below:
JIT_DEBUG | Effect
------|-------
0     | None
1     | Nothing for now
2     | Displays blueprint and scop
3     | Displays schedule-graph
4     | Displays memory-planner and the compiled code

  (title "How to learn JIT")
  (body "You can start by reading `./caten/docs/getting-started.lisp` to understand the basic concepts of `caten/codegen` through a running example.

Additionally, the following sections provide documentation and explanations for each JIT mechanism, along with simple executable examples.")
