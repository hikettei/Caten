(defpackage #:caten/codegen/scheduler
  (:documentation "
`caten/codegen/scheduler` is responsible for partitioning a (huge amount of!) computation graph into several smaller subgraphs with the same iteration space.

`graph-schedule` as en entry point, it receives a graph of `caten/aasm` created by running `caten/apis/iseq.lisp`, and returns a graph of `Schedule-Item`.
One Schedule-Item corresponds to one kernel in GPU. Therefore, in general, the more computation grouped in the same group, the better, in term of the memory-locality. Loops may be distributed elsewhere, but never fused except for `recursive-create-group`.")

Schedule-Item is an intermidate object to represent a one kernel in GPU.

```
f = cache_name or name
write_ids = f(*[storage_id_dst], *[dynamic_shape], *[inputs])
                      ^ can be modified by the memory-planner
```

It has a unique `name`, and `cache-name`. If `cache-name` was assigned, the compiler will fail to compile this schedule-item and reuse the kernel named `cache-name` instead.

In order to lowering the computation graph as the foreign language, `items` must be consisted of JITAble operations (except for special irs and :allocate). If it qualifies, `jitable` is set to T.

Otherwise, the scheduled items are relocated to the compiled avm directly. Specifially, if the item was :ALLOCATE, :allocated-p is set to T.

- blueprint[list] is a lowered schedule-item
- polyhedral[list] is a Polyhedral IR obtained by lowering blueprint
- auto-schedule-p[list] is set to T if it is worth to run auto-scheduler. (If there is a symbolic incremental, loop is not an affine and cannot run isl scheduler)
- items[list] are the scheduled items
- items-to-cache[list] are the copies of items but having the unique read/write. It is used to determine the equivalence of the two schedule-items.
- rank[fixnum] is the highest rank of the iteration space.
- storage-id-src[list] is the list of the storage-id of the source buffer (optimized by running memory-planner)
- storage-id-dst[list] is the list of the storage-id of the destination buffer (optimized by running memory-planner)

     Group1

      SELF
```
Consider the case where group1 and self fusion was rejected by the group-reduce-dims rule, group1 is a reduction, and `MOVE` after the reduction is merged to `self`. For example:
```
[Group1]
{
  int _acc_0 = 0;
  for (...)
    _acc_0 += ...;
  // Expected element wise operation here! otherwise we have to mutate _acc_0 as an array...
}
[SELF]
{
  for (...)
   out[...] = f(_acc_0);
}
```
This function enumerates all such pairs and allows all reduction operations to have a `MOVE` node after the reduction by serializing the loop. (This scheduling pattern can be observed by running an operation with multiple reductions in a single kernel, such as `!argmax`, or `RMSNorm`, etc.)

To put it bluntly, this function explores all `reduced-but-not-stored` pairs, and merges two schedule items who shares `reduced-but-not-stored`.

If this interrupts the parallelism, AutoScheduler should distribute them and create a shared buffer."
