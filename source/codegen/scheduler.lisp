  (:documentation "
The `caten/codegen/scheduler` is responsible for assigining the execution order of the computation graph in the aasm.
Occasionally they merges or rewrites a view in order to schedule multiple nodes into the same schedule if possible.

The function `graph-schedule` is an entry point, and takes a shape-inferred aasm graph as input, performs scheduling, and returns a schedule graph (called Schedule-Graph) whose each node is composed of Schedule-Item.

One Schedule-Item corresponds to one kernel in GPU, `graph-schedule` must ensure that each item is merged only within the bounds that can be lowered into a single kernel.")

(defnode (:GRAPH :Schedule-Item) ()
         "
Schedule-Item is an intermidate object to represent a one kernel in GPU.

```
f = cache_name or name
write_ids = f(*[storage_id_dst], *[dynamic_shape], *[inputs])
                      ^ can be modified by the memory-planner
```

It has a unique `name`, and `cache-name`. If `cache-name` was assigned, the compiler will fail to compile this schedule-item and reuse the kernel named `cache-name` instead.

In order to lowering the computation graph as the foreign language, `items` must be consisted of JITAble operations (except for special irs and :allocate). If it qualifies, `jitable` is set to T.

Otherwise, the scheduled items are relocated to the compiled avm directly. Specifially, if the item was :ALLOCATE, :allocated-p is set to T.

- blueprint[list] is a lowered schedule-item
- polyhedral[list] is a Polyhedral IR obtained by lowering blueprint
- auto-schedule-p[list] is set to T if it is worth to run auto-scheduler. (If there is a symbolic incremental, loop is not an affine and cannot run isl scheduler)
- items[list] are the scheduled items
- items-to-cache[list] are the copies of items but having the unique read/write. It is used to determine the equivalence of the two schedule-items.
- rank[fixnum] is the highest rank of the iteration space.
- storage-id-src[list] is the list of the storage-id of the source buffer (optimized by running memory-planner)
- storage-id-dst[list] is the list of the storage-id of the destination buffer (optimized by running memory-planner)
- namespace[list] a list of symbols appeared in the items. It is used to map a new blueprint from the cached blueprint.
